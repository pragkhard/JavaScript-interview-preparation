Primitive and non primitive 
-------------------------------

* Primitive values are the immutable [which cant be modified after creation.]
* Primitive are stored by value.
* Ex:: number, string, Boolean, null, undefined

* Non-Primitive values are the mutable [which can be modified after creation.]
* Non-Primitive are stored by reference.
* Ex: object, array, function

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

null and undefined are both primitive types in JavaScript, but they have different meanings and use cases.

undefined means a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned any value yet. It is assigned automatically by JavaScript when no value is given.

null, on the other hand, is a value that we explicitly assign to a variable to represent "no value" or an "empty reference."

In simple terms:

undefined is set by JavaScript when a variable is uninitialized.

null is set by the developer to indicate that a variable is intentionally empty.
