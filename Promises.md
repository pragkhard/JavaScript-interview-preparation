Promises-
------------
* Promises can handle the asynchronous calls in JavaScript.
* A Promise in JavaScript is an object that holds the future value of an asynchronous operation. 
* A promise will be "pending" when executed and will result in "resolved" or "rejected", depending on the response of the asynchronous call.

A JavaScript Promise object can be:
-------------------------------------
* Pending: it is an initial state, where the result is not ready, and it is waiting for the asynchronous operation to get finished.
* Resolved/Fulfilled: it means that performed action completed successfully. i.e., Function returned promised value.
* Rejected: it means that performed action failed or an error occurred. i.e., function did not return the promised value.
* Promises avoid the problem of "callback hell", which happens due to nested callback functions.
