What is a Closure in JavaScript?
===================================

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function remembers and accesses variables from the outer functionâ€™s scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
This is useful for data encapsulation, function factories, and preserving state across invocations.

Example:
----------
        function outerFunction() {
        let count = 0;
        
        return function innerFunction() {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        };
        }
        
        const counter = outerFunction();
        counter(); // 1
        counter(); // 2

Explanation:
outerFunction returns innerFunction.
innerFunction forms a closure and "remembers" the count variable from its parent scope.
Even though outerFunction has finished execution, counter() still has access to count.

OR 
===

        function outerFunction() {
            let count = 0;
            
            function innerFunction() {
                count++;
                console.log(count);
            };
            return innerFunction;
            }
            
            const counter = outerFunction();
            counter(); // 1
            counter(); // 2

Purpose: Returns innerFunction so you can call it later.

If i call like this way nothing will happen / Not getting output - 
------------------------------------------------------------------

        function outerFunction() {
            let count = 0;
            
            return function innerFunction() {
                count++;
                console.log(count);
            };
            }
            
        outerFunction();

 
If you not return the inner function then you do need to call the inner function (inner())
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            function outerFunction() {
                let count = 0;
                
                function innerFunction() {
                    count++;
                    console.log(count);
                }
                
                innerFunction(); 
                innerFunction();
            }
            outerFunction(); 

Purpose: Calls innerFunction twice immediately within outerFunction.

Where Closures Are Useful:
---------------------------
Creating private variables
Maintaining state in async code
In loops and callbacks
Memoization and function factories
           
 

Question 1: What is Lexical Scope?
-----------------------------------
Explanation: Lexical scope refers to how variable names are resolved in nested functions based on where the functions are defined. In the provided code, the function local has a local scope where it can access variables defined within itself as well as variables in the global scope, such as the username variable.

Question 2: How does Closure work?
--------------------------------------
Explanation: Closure is a JavaScript feature that allows a function to remember and access its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. In the code snippet, makeFunc creates a closure around the name variable, enabling displayName to access name even after makeFunc has finished running.

Question 3: Explain Closure Scope Chain.
-------------------------------------------
Explanation: Closure scope chain refers to the hierarchy of nested functions and their respective scopes that closures have access to. The sum function creates nested closures, allowing access to variables like a, b, c, d, and e from different levels of scope within the chain.

Question 4: What will be the output of the provided code snippet?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The code snippet defines an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that declares a global variable count and a local variable count inside the printCount function. The output will be 1 followed by 0 because of variable shadowing and the conditional check inside printCount.

Question 5: Write a function similar to addSix() using closures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The createBase function returns a closure that adds a base number (6 in this case) to an inner number provided as an argument. The addSix function created using createBase(6) adds 6 to its argument when invoked.

Question 6: How can closures be used for time optimization?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The find function precomputes an array of squares and returns a closure that can access this precomputed data. This approach optimizes time by avoiding redundant computations, as demonstrated by the timed execution of closure(6) and closure(50).

Question 7: How would you create a private counter using closure?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The counter function utilizes closure to create a private variable _counter that can only be accessed and modified through the returned functions add and retrieve, ensuring data privacy and controlled access.

Question 8: Explain the Module Pattern and provide an example.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The Module Pattern uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to encapsulate private variables and functions, exposing only a public interface. In the given example, the module object has a public method publicMethod, while privateMethod remains hidden within the module.

Question 9: How can you ensure a function runs only once using closure?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The Like function returns a closure that tracks the number of times it has been called, ensuring its action (like subscribing) is performed only once. Subsequent calls to the closure display a message indicating that the action has already been performed.

Question 10: Explain the Once Polyfill using closure.
--------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The once function creates a closure that allows a given function to be executed only once. Upon the first call, the original function runs, and subsequent calls return the result of the initial execution, demonstrating how closure can control function execution.

Question 11: What is Memoize Polyfill, and how does it use closure?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: The myMemoize function is a memoization polyfill that caches function results based on arguments, using closure to store and retrieve cached values efficiently. This improves performance by avoiding redundant computations for repeated function calls with the same arguments.

Question 12: Differentiate between Closure and Scope.
----------------------------------------------------------
Explanation: Closure refers to a function's ability to retain access to variables from its lexical scope even after that scope has closed, while scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a specific context, such as global scope, function scope, or block scope.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In other words-
------------------

* Closers in action that is inner function can have access to outer function variable as well as all the global variables.
* Closers is the combination of the function. Its bind together with the lexical scope.

Suppose we have nested function.
-------------------------------

        Function outer(){
            Function inner(){
        //so this inner function access to the outer function.
        }
        }

Example - 
Simply we can access the value 

        function x() {
            var a = 7;
            function y() {
                console.log(a);
            }
            y();
        }
        x();

        O/p -7

Using closers -

        function x() {
                var a = 7;
                function y() {
                    console.log(a);
                }
                return y;
            }
            var z = x();
            console.log(z);
            z();
        
        O/p - [Function: y]
              7   


Data Hiding, Data Privacy and Encapsulation we can achieve by closers.

Without closers - 

        var sum = function (a) {
                var c = 5;
                return function (b) {
                    return a + b + c;
                }
            }
            var res = sum(2);
            console.log(res(5));

            O/p- 12


        var sum = function (a) {
                var c = 5;
                return function (b) {
                    return a + b + c;
                }
            }
            var res = sum(2);
            console.log(res(5));

        O/p- 12
            

Closers- 

            function sum(a) {
                    return function (b) {
                        return function (c) {
                            console.log(a + b + c);
                        }
                    }
                }
                var res = sum(2);
                var data = res(3);
                var data1 = data(4);
                console.log(data1);        

                O/p- 9
                    undefined
