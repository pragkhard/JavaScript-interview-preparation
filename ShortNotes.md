role and responsibilities -
----------------------------
In my current role, I develop functional components using ReactJS and manage state with Redux. I also integrate RESTful APIs into the application and fix bugs. After development, I execute test cases using React Testing Library and Jest, achieving 85% test coverage. Additionally, I handle the deployment process using AWS for hosting the application and Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.
