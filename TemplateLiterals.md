What is template literals in ES6?
------------------------------------
* Template literal allows concatenation and interpolation.
* In ES6 it is done by “backtick” in a single line. To interpolation a variable simply put into {} braces forwarded by $ sign.

       let a = "Hello";
       let b = "Pragati";
       let c = `${(a)} ${b}`;
       console.log(c);
